/**
 * Chat channels: the agents, reachable from a phone.
 *
 * The web UI answers "what are they doing"; a channel answers "make them do something,
 * from wherever I am". One message in, the addressed agent runs a full turn, and what
 * it said comes back as the reply — the same transcript, the same policy gate, the
 * same budget as every other way in. A channel is a front door, not a second product.
 *
 * **Closed by default.** A bot handle is discoverable, and "anyone who finds it can
 * drive a machine with a shell" is not a default anyone chose. The allow list lives in
 * the config file; an unauthorised sender is told their own `channel:id`, which is
 * exactly the string the owner needs to add. An empty list means nobody.
 *
 * Each adapter owns its own wire (long polling, a websocket) and reports its state
 * here; a channel that cannot connect says so in the settings dialog rather than
 * failing silently. Secrets arrive as environment variables — including via the
 * config file's env map — never as constructor literals.
